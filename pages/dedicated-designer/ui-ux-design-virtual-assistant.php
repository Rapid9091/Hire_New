             <li><strong>Hiring a UX Designer Just to Make Beautiful Prototypes</strong></li>
                    <p class="text_content">That’s a common misconception. Employers often focus on prototyping and storyboarding in UX design, the initial visual stage of development.
Although the designer delivers and creates beautiful design items, the target customer’s core analysis may have been overlooked.
 You need a user interface (UI) designer, not a UX designer, If all you want is a beautiful design. The user experience focuses on people, their experience, and your product’s identity—not just how it looks.</p>

                    <li><strong>Hiring UX Designer Just for a UX Audit</strong></li>
                    <p class="text_content">Designers (User experience ) may also come into a project in the auditing phase or when the meat of the project is nearly finished. The important  task for the UX designer at this stage might be to edit the website, look over or copy the graphics and texts. As mentioned, the UX development process focuses on understanding the audience and user experience. So, hiring a designer to check some product parts is not a good idea.</p>

                    <li><strong>Hire a Freelance UI/UX Designer:</strong></li>
                    <p class="text_content">Hiring a freelance UI/UX designer is great for small companies and short-term projects.

                    <li><strong>Hire an outsourcing organisation:</strong></li>
                    <p class="text_content">Outsourcing enables organisations to reduce operational costs and avoid investment in employer training, benefits, and onboarding.

                    <li><strong>Staff augments: A unique way of outsourcing:</strong></li>

Still, unlike assigning or handing over an entire design project to an IT outsourcing company, communicate with them directly, and organisations manage UX designers.</p>

                    <li><strong>Hire UI UX Designer In-house</strong></li>
