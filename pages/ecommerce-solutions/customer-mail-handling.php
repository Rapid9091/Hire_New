                        <p class="text">SEO (search engine optimization) is sometimes used as a catch-all word for SEM
                            (Search engine marketing). SEM, on the other hand, refers to sponsored advertising. As a
                            result, the two words should be distinguished. This is because SEM is about delivering
                            bought traffic to a website, but SEO is about bringing organic traffic to a site and
                            monitoring traffic trends.</p>

                        <p class="text">The primary driver of search engine results is high-quality, authoritative
                            content, and there is no alternative for unique and excellent material. This is especially
                            true while performing SEO marketing. Excellent content for your target audience increases
                            site traffic, increasing the relevance and authority of your site.</p>
