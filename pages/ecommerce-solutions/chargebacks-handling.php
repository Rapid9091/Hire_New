            <h2 class="content-heading">How do we understand chargebacks?</h2>

            <p class="text_content">Chargebacks are done for charges that have been fully processed and settled. They
                must be
                reversed through an electronic process involving multiple entities. As a result, they can take several
                days to
                settle and return to the original account fully.</p>

            <p class="text_content">The chargeback process is similar across most credit card networks and issuing
                banks, with
                specific differences for each bank or network. A chargeback works from the issuing bank through the card
                network and
                to the merchant's acquiring bank. The merchant can decide to dispute the chargeback or accept it.</p>

            <p class="text_content">Chargebacks are a consumer protection tool that allows consumers to get their
                moneyback for
                fraudulent charges or purchases that don’t live up to standards by submitting a dispute with their card
                issuer.
            </p>
            <p class="text_content">If you notice a transaction on your credit card account that doesn’t look familiar
                or run
                into
                issues with a recent order, you may want to (and should) dispute the transaction. Generally, you’ll have
                two
                options
                when disputing a transaction: refund or chargeback.</p>
            <p class="text_content">A refund comes directly from a merchant, while a chargeback comes from your card
                issuer.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="content_div">
            <h2 class="content-heading">When to ask for a chargeback</h2>

            <div class="ul_div">
                <ul>


                <li>A chargeback is the payment amount returned to a debit or credit card after a customer disputes the
                    transaction.
                </li>
                <li>The merchant or the cardholder’s issuing bank can initiate the chargeback process.</li>
                <li>Merchants typically incur a fee from the card issuer when a chargeback occurs.</li>
                <li>Federal law requires card issuers to offer chargebacks within 60 days of the billing date.</li>
                <li>In cases other than fraud, you may be able to resolve your issue directly with the merchant rather
                    than by requesting a chargeback from your bank.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3><strong>Charges can be disputed for many reasons, such as</strong></h3>
            <div class="ul_div">
                <ul>
                <li>A cardholder being charged by a merchant for items they never received</li>
                <li>A merchant duplicating an order by mistake</li>
                <li>Mistaken costs caused by a technical issue</li>
                <li>Fraudulent charges from credit or debit card information that has been compromised</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

        </div>

        <div class="content_div">
            <h2 class="content-heading">What Is the Chargeback Process?</h2>
            <p class="text_content">The primary participants in the chargeback process are the cardholder, the merchant,
                the
                issuing bank, the acquiring bank, and sometimes the credit card network.</p>
            <h3><strong>The cardholder/customer</strong></h3>
            <p class="text_content">These may be the same individual, but only sometimes. The cardholder is the actual
                owner
                of the payment card used to purchase the dispute. The customer is the individual who placed the
                transaction.
            </p>
            <p class="text_content">In a typical transaction or a friendly fraud chargeback, the cardholder and the
                customer
                are the same person. In an actual fraud scenario, the customer who made a transaction with a stolen card
                is
                not the same person as the cardholder who disputes it later.</p><br>


            <h3><strong> 1) The merchant</strong></h3>
            <p class="text_content">is the individual or company who sold a product or service to the customer. When the
                chargeback is filed, the merchant must decide whether to accept or dispute it.</p><br>


            <h3><strong> 2)The issuing bank (Issuer):</strong></h3>
            <p class="text_content">A bank or other financial institution that issues a branded payment card to the
                cardholder. Examples: Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Capital One.</p><br>
            <h3><strong> 3)The acquiring bank (Acquirer)</strong></h3>
            <p class="text_content">The merchant’s bank holds their merchant account and enables them to accept credit
                card
                payments.</p><br>


            <h3><strong> 4)The credit card network:</strong></h3>
            <p class="text_content">The association that owns the credit card brand used in the transaction. The four
                major
                credit card networks in the United States are Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. These
                networks set the terms for credit card transactions, followed by the issuing banks.</p><br>
            <p class="text_content">Other companies that service merchant accounts, such as payment processors and
                gateways,
                may also become involved in the chargeback process.</p><br>


        </div>
        <div class="content_div">
            <h2 class="content-heading"> What is Chargeback Processing?</h2>

            <p class="text_content">The merchant or the cardholder’s issuing bank can initiate the chargeback process. If started with a merchant, the process is similar to a  standard transaction; however, the funds are taken from a merchant’s  account and deposited with the cardholder’s issuing bank.</p>

                This varies by the payment processor but is usually around 30 days. At this time, the merchant can
                provide the signed receipts, contracts, and any other documentation that shows that the chargeback is in
                error.</p>

            <h2 class="content-heading">Why do chargebacks happen?</h2>
            <p class="text_content">When a credit card company issues a chargeback, they use a code to indicate the
                reason for the reversal. There are four general chargeback code categories:</p>
            <li><strong>1 Fraud</strong></li>

            <h3><strong>1) Fraud</strong></h3>
            <p class="text_content">Chargebacks exist to make it safer for customers to shop. They protect against other
                fraudulent purchases made without the buyer’s knowledge or consent. Fraud is the most common reason for
                a chargeback.</p>
            <p class="text_content">Chargebacks with the following reason codes have been requested due to fraudulent

            <h2 class="content-heading">What is friendly fraud?</h2>
            <h3><strong>Illegitimate chargebacks (friendly fraud)</strong></h3><br>
            <p class="text_content">Sometimes, customers will initiate chargebacks despite receiving their purchases.</p>
            <p class="text_content">Termed “friendly fraud,” illegitimate chargebacks can occur because consumers are
                unhappy with their products, are confused about payments, or are simply trying to gain a free product.
                It’s estimated that 61% of all chargebacks happen due to friendly fraud. </p>
            <p class="text_content">Nicolas Tranchant, founder of jewellery store Vivalatina, says, “The biggest reason
                for our chargebacks has been the client’s dishonesty. Sixty per cent of them are claimed without even an
                email to explain a problem with the jewellery we had shipped to them, with no explanation and no intent
                to allow us to solve the issue.”</p>
            <p class="text_content">In these cases, merchants can dispute customer chargebacks to regain funds.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content_div">
            <h2 class="content-heading">How do you dispute a chargeback?:</h2>
            <p class="text_content">Respond as quickly as possible when disputing a chargeback since delayed action may
                result in a chargeback loss.</p>
                <br>
            <h3><strong>1) Gather information</strong></h3>
            <p class="text_content">Identify the customer and transaction in question when you’re notified of a
                chargeback. Source as much information about the transaction as possible, including warehouse data and
                delivery status. </p>
            <p class="text_content">You can also contact the customer directly to see if their issue can be resolved.
            </p><br>
            <h3><strong>2) Submit your chargeback response</strong></h3>
            <p class="text_content">If you feel that a chargeback has been made unfairly, you can submit your evidence
                in a dispute response.</p>
            <p class="text_content">This document is returned to the bank or card issuer that sent you the chargeback
                letter (alternatively, you may need to initiate your own chargeback dispute). Follow any formatting</p>
            <p class="text_content">instructions and deadlines, and ensure you directly respond to the chargeback’s
                reason code.
            <p class="text_content">For disputed fraud or “no authorisation” chargebacks, provide evidence that the
                cardholder was aware of and authorised the transaction. AVS (address verification system) matches, CVV
                confirmations, signed receipts, or contracts may help to prove this.</p><br>
            <h3><strong>3) Await the decision</strong></h3>
            <p class="text_content">After you submit a rebuttal, the situation is out of your hands while the
                processor’s acquiring bank reviews the information. The cardholder’s bank makes the final decision about
                whether it will process the chargeback, and it will inform the customer of its decision.</p><br>
            <h3><strong>4) Disputing chargebacks</strong></h3>
            <p class="text_content">Consumers benefit from the protection chargebacks provide against fraud and poor
                customer service.</p>
            <p class="text_content">Chargeback rules promote fair return policies and discourage retailers from selling
                subpar products. But, when consumers abuse the chargeback system, merchants can face unexpected losses
                and fees.</p>
            <p class="text_content">Merchants can recover disputed funds by submitting evidence to a consumer’s credit
                card company, showing that the customer authorised the transaction and received their purchase.</p>

            <h3><strong>1) What is Process flow?</strong></h3><br>
            <p class="text_content">As depicted in the below process flow, a chargeback will complete a full circle. It
                is initiated by the cardholder and issuing bank, and ultimately, your response will be presented to the
                cardholder and issuing bank.</p>

                <p class="text_content"> The initial chargeback—the reversal of the transaction the cardholder is
                    disputing—should be posted to Accounts Receivable. This positions each chargeback as funds owed to
                    you and which you expect to recover. You can also create a special designation for this, such as
                    “Accounts Receivable Chargebacks.”</p>

            <div class="content_div">
                <h2 class="content-heading">What is CHARGEBACKS INSURANCE?</h2>

                <p class="text_content"> A chargeback occurs when an agent has to pay back a portion of their commission
                    because their client passes away or cancels an insurance policy early. Each company's chargeback
                    schedule and contract is slightly different, and chargeback rules vary by product line.</p>

                    <div class="faq__content">
                        <p class="text">SEO (search engine optimization) is sometimes used as a catch-all word for SEM
                            (Search engine marketing). SEM, on the other hand, refers to sponsored advertising. As a
                            result, the two words should be distinguished. This is because SEM is about delivering
                            bought traffic to a website, but SEO is about bringing organic traffic to a site and
                            monitoring traffic trends.</p>

                    <div class="faq__content">
                        <p class="text">The primary driver of search engine results is high-quality, authoritative
                            content, and there is no alternative for unique and excellent material. This is especially
                            true while performing SEO marketing. Excellent content for your target audience increases
                            site traffic, increasing the relevance and authority of your site.</p>
