                        <p class="text">If after reading all of this you still don't know what a virtual personal assistant is, let me sum it up in one statement. A VA is a skilled professional that offers technical, administrative, and creative support to business owners, entrepreneurs, and other professionals.</p>
                        <p class="text">At the expense of the comfort they receive in exchange, a virtual personal assistant is paid nothing for holidays, meals, or other advantages.</p>
                        <p class="text">A virtual personal assistant works from the comfort of their home or other location; they are not really present at the workplace.</p>

                    <div class="faq__content">
                        <p class="text">If your employee is a virtual personal assistant, you are not at the office to see if he is working or not. How can you tell if your virtual personal assistant is effective, then?</p>
                        <p class="text">The advantage of using a virtual personal assistant versus a non-working staff is that you just pay for the hours they work. The choice to pay for the quantity of work completed is also available.</p>
                        <p class="text">If you are a skeptic and find it difficult to trust your virtual assistant, you should look for a qualified individual with a solid track record who also meets deadlines, like those found at Hire Coworker.</p>
