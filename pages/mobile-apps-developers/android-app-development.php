    <h2 class="content-heading">What is an Android App?</h2>
    <p class="text_content">An Android app is software created to work on devices using the Android operating system.
    </p><br>

    <p class="text_content">An Android app is a type of software specifically created for smartphones or tablet
        computers that run on the Android operating system.</p><br>

    <p class="text_content">Android apps are created using a programming language called Java, and they rely on a set of
        pre-built tools and functions called Java core libraries. </p><br>

    <p class="text_content">Before apps can run on your mobile device, they must be converted into a format the machine
        can understand. This process is called compilation.</p><br>

    <p class="text_content"> In the case of Android apps, they are compiled into Dalvik executables. These executables
        are designed to be run on the Dalvik virtual machine, a particular virtual machine created explicitly for mobile
        devices.</p><br>

    <p class="text_content">Customers can download the Android software development kit (SDK) from the official Android
        website. </p><br>

    <p class="text_content">The SDK (Software Development Kit) package contains helpful tools, sample code, and
        documents that you can use to create apps for Android devices.</p><br>

    <p class="text_content">App Inventor is a tool that is helpful for beginner developers who are interested in
        exploring Android programming. It allows them to create and experiment with their own Android apps easily. </p>
    <br>
</div>
<div class="content_div">
    <h2 class="content-heading">What is Android App Development?</h2>
    <p class="text_content">Android development is software engineering that builds applications for Android operating
        system devices.</p><br>

    <p class="text_content">Android App development involves using different programming languages to create
        applications for Android devices. </p><br>

    <p class="text_content">These applications comprise four main components that work together to make the app function
        correctly.</p><br>
</div>
<div class="content_div">
    <h2 class="content-heading">Language use in Android App Development</h2>
    <p class="text_content">Developers use Java as the primary programming language to create Android device
        applications. </p><br>

    <p class="text_content">When you write code in Java, it is converted into a format that can be understood and
        executed by the Dalvik Virtual Machine responsible for running Android apps</p><br>

    <p class="text_content">Most Android APIs are created to be compatible with Java, the primary programming language
        used in Android Studio. Android App developers can use various programming languages for their development work.
    </p><br>

    <p class="text_content">React Native app development is a prevalent method for creating applications. React Native
        technology enables developers to build mobile applications for both iOS and Android platforms. </p><br>

    <p class="text_content">It uses JavaScript, a popular programming language, and familiar user interface frameworks
        to speed up development. </p><br>

    <p class="text_content">C# is a programming language that takes elements from both C++ and Java. It is designed to
        be user-friendly and allows beginners to create Android applications.</p><br>

    <p class="text_content">In addition to Java, developers utilize other programming languages such as C/C++, Kotlin,
        BASIC, and Lua for Android App development.</p><br>
</div>
<div class="content_div">
    <h2 class="content-heading">What are Components of an Android App?</h2>
    <h3><strong>Activities</strong></h3>
    <p class="text_content">Activity is where the user starts interacting with the app. The device has a single screen
        that displays information and allows users to interact with it through a user-friendly interface. </p><br>

    <p class="text_content">An email app has different activities for different tasks: one to view new emails, compose
        emails, and read emails. </p><br>

    <p class="text_content">The activities in the email app work together for a cohesive user experience. However, each
        movement is separate from the others.</p><br>

    <p class="text_content">Another app can initiate any of these activities if the email app allows. A camera app
    <p class="text_content">can open the email app to help the user send a picture.</p><br>

    <p class="text_content">The activity helps the system and app interact in significant ways:</p>
    <div class=”ul_div”>
        <ul>
            <li>The system needs to know what the user is currently focused on to continue running the corresponding
                process.</li>
            <li>The system keeps track of processes with stopped activities so users can quickly return to them. It
                gives them higher priority to ensure they remain available.</li>
            <li>They assist the app in handling process termination, allowing users to resume activities with their
                previous state intact.</li>
            <li>We are enabling apps to connect and interact with each other, with the system managing these
                interactions. The primary example is sharing.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>


    <h3><strong>Services</strong></h3>
    <p class="text_content">Services are used to keep an app running in the background while the user is doing
    <p class="text_content">something else on their device. Service is when the music continues to play while using
        another app. </p><br>

    <p class="text_content"><strong>There are two types of services available:</strong></p><br>

    <p class="text_content">Started Services: This feature allows an app to continue running in the background until it
        finishes its task or process.</p><br>

    <p class="text_content">Bound Services :This means that the app is still running because either another app or the
        system itself is using it for its own operations.</p><br>
        <p class="text_content"><strong>Content Provider :</strong>A content provider is a tool that helps manage data collections that can be stored in a file
        system and accessed by an application.</p><br>
   

    <p class="text_content"> Content providers are a feature that allows authorized apps to access and make changes to
        specific data. </p><br>

    <p class="text_content">An example would be a service that helps you manage your contact information. It will enable
        apps that have been permitted to access and update the contact information to do so.</p><br>
        <p class="text_content"><strong>Broadcast Receiver :</strong>A broadcast receiver lets the system send events to an app outside its regular use, like
        system-wide announcements. </p><br>

    <p class="text_content">An app can schedule an alarm to remind the user about an upcoming event. The app can send a
        notice to the broadcast receiver, making it close until the alarm sounds. </p><br>

    <p class="text_content">The system sends broadcasts to inform users about events such as shutdowns, low battery
        levels, or when a picture has been taken.</p><br>
</div>
<div class="content_div">
    <h2 class="content-heading">Why Android App Development Important?</h2>
    <p class="text_content">Having a mobile app for your online business is very important. Mobile apps have
        revolutionized the way we conduct business operations.</p><br>

    <p class="text_content"> These apps make it easier for customers to quickly access business information, stay
        connected with their favorite brands, and receive updates and offers. </p><br>

    <p class="text_content">Apps are crucial in helping businesses reach more customers and increase their brand
        visibility.</p><br>
