<h2 class="content-heading">>Web Application</h2>
<p class="text_content">A web application, or web app, is software stored on a server and accessed through a web browser. </p> <br>

<p class="text_content">This means you can use the application without downloading or installing anything on your device. It is delivered over the Internet, making it convenient and accessible from anywhere with an Internet connection. </p> <br>

<p class="text_content">Web services are an application that can be accessed through the Internet. They are often included within websites, but not all websites have web services.</p> <br>

<p class="text_content">Developers create web applications that serve different purposes and cater to various users. Depending on their specific needs and goals, these applications can be designed for organizations or individuals. </p> <br>

<p class="text_content">Web applications are online tools that you can use through your web browser. Some examples of commonly used web applications are webmail, which allows you to access and manage your email online, online calculators that help you with math or financial calculations, and e-commerce shops, where you can buy products or services online. </p> <br>

<p class="text_content">Some web apps can only be accessed using a particular browser. However, most web apps can be accessed using any browser.</p> <br>

<h2 class="content-heading">>How Web Application Work</h2>
<p class="text_content">Web applications can be used without downloading because they can be accessed directly through a network connection. </p> <br>

<p class="text_content">To access a web application, customers can use popular web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari.</p> <br>

<p class="text_content">A web app to function correctly requires three main components: a web server, an application server, and a database.</p> <br> 

<p class="text_content">The web server handles incoming requests from users and delivers the appropriate web pages to their browsers.</p> <br>

<p class="text_content"> It is the intermediary between the user's device and the web app. The application server is where the core logic and functionality of the web app reside. </p> <br>

<p class="text_content">It processes the requests from the web server, performs the necessary computations, and generates the appropriate responses to be sent back to the user.</p> <br>

 <p class="text_content">Lastly, the database is where all the data related to the web app is stored. It acts as a repository for Web servers responsible for handling the requests made by a user's device, like a computer or smartphone. </p> <br>

<p class="text_content">They manage these requests and ensure they are sent to the right place.On the other hand, application servers are in charge of carrying out the tasks the user requested. </p> <br>

<p class="text_content">They process the information and perform the necessary actions to complete the job. A database is a tool that stores important information that is needed for various purposes.</p> <br>

<p class="text_content">Web applications are software programs that run on the Internet. They are usually created by small groups of developers and are developed quickly.</p> <br>

<p class="text_content"> Web developers primarily use three primary programming languages to create web applications: JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. </p> <br>

<p class="text_content">JavaScript is a programming language that makes websites interactive and dynamic <br>
 It is responsible for making web pages interactive and responsive to user actions.</p> <br>

<p class="text_content"> HTML5 is the standard markup language for structuring and presenting content on the web. It provides a web page's basic structure and layout, including headings, paragraphs, and images. </p> <br>

<p class="text_content">Client-side programming refers to using specific languages to create an application's visual and interactive parts that users see and interact with.</p> <br>

<p class="text_content"> These languages are primarily focused on building the front end of an application. Server-side programming refers to creating the scripts or codes that a web application will use on the server, which is the computer that hosts the website. </p> <br>

<p class="text_content">These scripts are responsible for handling various tasks and functionalities of the web application. Python, Java, and Ruby are popular programming languages often used for server-side programming.</p> <br>
