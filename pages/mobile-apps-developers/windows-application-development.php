            <h2 class="content-heading">Web Application</h2>
            <p class="text_content">A web application, or web app, is software stored on a server and accessed through a
                web browser. </p> <br>

            <p class="text_content">This means you can use the application without downloading or installing anything on
                your device. It is delivered over the Internet, making it convenient and accessible from anywhere with
                an Internet connection. </p> <br>

            <p class="text_content">Web services are an application that can be accessed through the Internet. They are
                often included within websites, but not all websites have web services.</p> <br>

            <p class="text_content">Developers create web applications that serve different purposes and cater to
                various users. Depending on their specific needs and goals, these applications can be designed for
                organizations or individuals. </p> <br>

            <p class="text_content">Web applications are online tools that you can use through your web browser. Some
                examples of commonly used web applications are webmail, which allows you to access and manage your email
                online, online calculators that help you with math or financial calculations, and e-commerce shops,
                where you can buy products or services online. </p> <br>

            <p class="text_content">Some web apps can only be accessed using a particular browser. However, most web

        <div class="content_div">
            <h2 class="content-heading">How Web Application Work</h2>
            <p class="text_content">Web applications can be used without downloading because they can be accessed
                directly through a network connection. </p> <br>

            <p class="text_content">To access a web application, customers can use popular web browsers like Google
                Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari.</p> <br>

            <p class="text_content">A web app to function correctly requires three main components: a web server, an
                application server, and a database.</p> <br>

            <p class="text_content">The web server handles incoming requests from users and delivers the appropriate web
                pages to their browsers.</p> <br>

            <p class="text_content"> It is the intermediary between the user's device and the web app. The application
                server is where the core logic and functionality of the web app reside. </p> <br>

            <p class="text_content">It processes the requests from the web server, performs the necessary computations,
                and generates the appropriate responses to be sent back to the user.</p> <br>

            <p class="text_content">Lastly, the database is where all the data related to the web app is stored. It acts
                as a repository for Web servers responsible for handling the requests made by a user's device, like a
                computer or smartphone. </p> <br>

            <p class="text_content">They manage these requests and ensure they are sent to the right place.On the other
                hand, application servers are in charge of carrying out the tasks the user requested. </p> <br>

            <p class="text_content">They process the information and perform the necessary actions to complete the job.
                A database is a tool that stores important information that is needed for various purposes.</p> <br>

            <p class="text_content">Web applications are software programs that run on the Internet. They are usually
                created by small groups of developers and are developed quickly.</p> <br>

            <p class="text_content"> Web developers primarily use three primary programming languages to create web
                applications: JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. </p> <br>

            <p class="text_content">JavaScript is a programming language that makes websites interactive and dynamic
                <br>
                It is responsible for making web pages interactive and responsive to user actions.</p> <br>

            <p class="text_content"> HTML5 is the standard markup language for structuring and presenting content on the
                web. It provides a web page's basic structure and layout, including headings, paragraphs, and images.
            </p> <br>

            <p class="text_content">Client-side programming refers to using specific languages to create an
                application's visual and interactive parts that users see and interact with.</p> <br>

            <p class="text_content"> These languages are primarily focused on building the front end of an application.
                Server-side programming refers to creating the scripts or codes that a web application will use on the
                server, which is the computer that hosts the website. </p> <br>

            <p class="text_content">These scripts are responsible for handling various tasks and functionalities of the
                web application. Python, Java, and Ruby are popular programming languages often used for server-side
                programming.</p> <br>

                initial version of the product was made available to customers in late 2003.</p> <br>

            <p class="text_content">As a developer, you will find Xcode's interface simple and focused on giving you the
                essential tools you need. </p> <br>

            <p class="text_content">The code you write is easier to work with because it has a built-in tool that checks
                for errors in the code and suggests possible completions as you type.</p> <br>

            <p class="text_content"> When you begin a new project, you have the option to select from pre-made templates
                that can be used as a starting point.</p> <br>

            <p class="text_content">These templates are already designed and can help you get started quickly. These
                features are designed to help beginner programmers learn and improve their skills by providing support
                and guidance as they gain more experience.</p> <br>

            <p class="text_content">Xcode is a software tool that helps developers write code for different programming
                languages like Swift, C, C++, and Objective-C.</p> <br>

            <p class="text_content"> Apple has created a software tool called the Integrated Development Environment
                (IDE) that has been around for almost 20 years. This tool has been improved and updated many times
                throughout its existence.</p> <br>

                        <p class="text">SEO (search engine optimization) is sometimes used as a catch-all word for SEM
                            (Search engine marketing). SEM, on the other hand, refers to sponsored advertising. As a
                            result, the two words should be distinguished. This is because SEM is about delivering
                            bought traffic to a website, but SEO is about bringing organic traffic to a site and
                            monitoring traffic trends.</p>

                            true while performing SEO marketing. Excellent content for your target audience increases
