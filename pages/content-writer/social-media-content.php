        <p class="p-pink">FAQs</p>
        <p class="section-heading">Do You Have Questions</p>
        <div class="faqs">

            <div class="faqs-child">
                <details>
                    <summary>What can my virtual assistant do for me on social media?</summary>
                    <div class="faq__content">
                        <p class="text">You could log in and manage almost anything. A virtual assistant cannot physically be present in your workplace, but they can log into your numerous social media networks, automate postings, do research, recognize trends, and much more. Ask a VA which hashtags are suitable for your next post. Ask a VA to put up an automatic system for scheduling postings. When you use a VA's experience, there is no limit to what you may do.</p>
                    </div>
                </details>
            </div>
            <div class="faqs-child">
                <details>
                    <summary>Is it difficult to train a virtual assistant for my particular accounts?</summary>
                    <div class="faq__content">
                        <p class="text">No, it shouldn't be hard. There may be a transition phase during which you will want to onboard your VA as precisely as feasible. Tell them exactly what you want. Inform them of the duties you anticipate them to complete. Respond to their inquiries. As time passes, the VA will have more autonomy and you will not have to check in as frequently.</p>
                    </div>
                </details>
            </div>
            <div class="faqs-child">
                <details>
                    <summary>Will my assistant be treated similarly to a full-time employee?</summary>
                    <div class="faq__content">
                        <p class="text">Yes, in some ways. No, in different ways. A virtual assistant might work as a part-time employee or as a full-time employee. They will not be physically present in your firm, but they have the potential to become crucial. Many VAs, on the other hand, discover that they prefer this structure to typical employment since it gives them more authority and influence over their own professional life. And for you, the business, better productivity, and a more prudent budget will help your company succeed.</p>
                    </div>
                </details>
            </div>
            <div class="faqs-child">
                <details>
                    <summary>How effective are virtual assistants at handling social media?</summary>
                    <div class="faq__content">
                        <p class="text">It is conditional. If you hire a general office assistant, you may have to train them. But, if you hire someone with a lot of expertise dealing with numerous social media outlets, you'll see that it might be quite different. Many high-quality VAs originate from the realm of social media and may even have a large presence themselves. In certain circumstances, a VA may be able to give advice and advise you on the best technique. You don't have to restrict yourself to automating the most basic chores like scheduling posts or researching in the background. A social media VA may be much more—if you employ the proper one.</p>
                    </div>
                </details>
            </div>
            <div class="faqs-child">
                <details>
                    <summary>Who is a virtual assistant for?</summary>
                    <div class="faq__content">
                        <p class="text">There is no one solution here, yet many people would benefit from having a VA. Executives, freelancers, entrepreneurs, C-level executives, social media managers, and others are all welcome. Everyone who has a lot of social media chores on their plate and wants to make sure they get more done during the day would benefit from the experience.
                           But we don't want you to believe that you are constrained by these definitions. The reality is that anyone who may profit from having more time in their working days as a result of being able to outsource some of their work to a social media virtual assistant will quickly recognize the benefit.</p>
