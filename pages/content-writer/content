    <h2 class="content-heading">Understanding MEP Engineering</h2>
    <p class="text_content">MEP engineering, or Building Services engineering, is crucial in construction. It's about
        planning, putting in, and looking after mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems in buildings. These systems
        are like the heart of a building, ensuring it works well, stays safe, and feels good to be in.</p><br>

    <p class="text_content"><strong>Key Aspects of MEP Design</p><br>


    <p class="text_content"><strong> 1)Mechanical Systems: </strong>These ensure indoor areas have the right temperature
        and good air quality using HVAC systems (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning).</p><br>


    <p class="text_content"><strong> 2)Electrical Systems:</strong> MEP engineers plan systems that give power to
        lights, machines, and tools. They also make sure these systems are safe and work well.</p><br>


    <p class="text_content"><strong> 3)Plumbing Systems:</strong> These are about getting clean and dirty water out. MEP
        engineers design these systems to provide clean water and adequately eliminate wastewater.</p><br>
