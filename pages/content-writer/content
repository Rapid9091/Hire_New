    <h2 class="content-heading">What is Construction Drawing</h2>
    <p class="text_content">A construction drawing isn't just lines on paper. It's like a picture of what an architect
        wants to build, the math an engineer does, and the skills of a builder. It's a miniature copy that shows all the
        details of a building, including how it looks and how things like electricity, water, and air systems work.
        These drawings are like a typical picture that everyone building the item can see.</p><br>

<div class="content_div">
    <h2 class="content-heading">Who Makes Construction Drawings and How?</h2>

    <p class="text_content">Construction drawings are a collaborative effort that involves multiple professionals
        working in tandem to bring a project to life. Architects lay the foundation by envisioning the design and
        creating drawings that outline spatial relationships and aesthetics. </p><br>

    <p class="text_content">Engineers, both structural and MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing), contribute their
        expertise by developing specialized drawings detailing the structural integrity and systems layout. These
        professionals utilize Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software to meticulously draft and annotate each aspect of the
        construction, ensuring accuracy down to the millimeter.</p><br>

    <h2 class="content-heading">The Criteria of a Comprehensive Construction Drawing</h2>

    <p class="text_content">A high-quality construction drawing is characterized by several critical criteria:
    <p class="text_content"><strong> 1)Clarity:</strong> Every line and annotation must be clear and easily
        understandable, leaving no room for ambiguity.</p><br>
    <p class="text_content"><strong> 2)Scale and Proportion:</strong> Accurate scaling ensures that real-world
        dimensions are faithfully represented, aiding builders in precise execution.</p><br>
    <p class="text_content"><strong> 3)Annotations and Labels: </strong> Properly labeled diagrams, symbols, and notes
        provide context, guiding contractors through the intricacies of the design.</p><br>
    <p class="text_content"><strong> 4)Layered Information:</strong> Different aspects, such as architectural,
        structural, and MEP, should be organized in layers, enabling selective visualization.</p><br>
    <p class="text_content"><strong> 5)Compliance:</strong> Drawings must adhere to local building codes, regulations,
        and industry standards, ensuring safety and legal compliance.</p><br>
