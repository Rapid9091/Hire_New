            <h2 class="content-heading">What exactly is a Virtual Assistant for a Website Developer?</h2>
            <p class="text_content">Having a website developer on your team is extremely beneficial, but employing a full-time, in-house developer can be costly. Most startups cannot afford one, and several established enterprises cannot afford a web development staff. It's a good thing you can engage a virtual assistant for website design and development.</p>
            <p class="text_content">A website developer virtual assistant, also known as a website developer VA, is a remote worker who specializes in the development of websites for a variety of purposes. Website developer virtual assistants have varied levels of experience. Some entry-level web developer VAs can only work on the front end of your website, which necessitates familiarity with style sheets such as HTML and CSS. Others can only make websites using website builders like WordPress, Wix, and Squarespace; they cannot code a website from scratch.</p>
            <p class="text_content">Intermediate to advanced level website developers, on the other hand, can handle all of the above as well as create custom websites with a variety of capabilities from the ground up. Memberships and logins, eCommerce functionality, security features, content management systems (CMS), and much more.</p>
