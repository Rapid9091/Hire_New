            <p class="text_content">The concept is to use data to improve the quality of services beyond what humans can

            <p class="text_content">However, there are several difficulties associated with traditional machine
                learning. To begin with, you would have to create a machine-learning model from the ground up</p></br>

                learning. This achievement is seen as a significant milestone in artificial intelligence, although it
                may seem insignificant compared to current capabilities.</p>
            <p class="text_content">Technological advancements have allowed the development of machine learning-based
                products like Netflix's recommendation engine and self-driving cars.</p><br>
            <p class="text_content">Machine learning is crucial in data science. Statistical methods train algorithms
                for making classifications, predictions, and uncovering insights in data mining projects. </p><br>
            <p class="text_content">These insights help make decisions in applications and businesses, to affect

            <p class="text_content">The demand for data scientists will increase as big data continues to grow. Users

            <h2 class="content-heading">What Is Machine Learning?</h2>
            <p class="text_content">Machine learning is a field where scientists create algorithms and models that
                enable computer systems to perform tasks without being explicitly told what to do.</p><br>
            <p class="text_content"> Instead, these systems rely on patterns and inference to make decisions and
                complete tasks. It is a specific area of study within the field of Artificial Intelligence</p>


        </div>
        <div class="content_div">
            <h2 class="content-heading">How does it work?</h2>

            <p class="text_content">Machine learning is a method that uses two different approaches. The first is
                supervised learning, where a model is trained using input and output data. </p>
            <p class="text_content"> This allows the model to make predictions about future outputs. The second
                approach, unsupervised learning, looks for hidden patterns or structures in the input data without any
                specific output information</p><br>

            <h3><strong>Supervised Learning</strong></h3>
            <p class="text_content">Supervised machine learning uses evidence to make predictions in uncertain
                situations:</p>
            <p class="text_content">A supervised learning algorithm uses known data and responses to train a model that
                can make predictions for new data. </p>
            <p class="text_content">Supervised learning is used when you have known data for the output you want to
                predict. </p><br>
            <h3><strong>Unsupervised Learning</strong></h3>
            <p class="text_content">Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that helps us discover hidden
                patterns or structures in data without prior knowledge or guidance. </p><br>
            <p class="text_content"> It allows us to uncover valuable insights and understand the underlying
                relationships within the data. This tool helps make conclusions from datasets with input data but no
                labeled responses. </p><br>
            <p class="text_content">For example, let's say an unsupervised learning program gives you a set of pictures
                of cats and dogs that are all different</p><br>
            <p class="text_content">The algorithm has yet to be trained on the dataset, so it doesn't know anything
                about its features.</p><br>
            <p class="text_content"> The unsupervised learning algorithm finds image features without guidance. The
                unsupervised learning algorithm clusters the image dataset based on similarities between images</p><br>

            <p class="text_content">Generative AI is a form of artificial intelligence that can generate fresh and
                original content and ideas.</p><br>
            <p class="text_content">This can include engaging in conversations, crafting stories, producing images,
                videos, and even composing music. </p><br>
            <p class="text_content">Generative AI, similar to other artificial intelligence systems, relies on machine

            <p class="text_content"> It creates new data by randomly selecting from a learned probability distribution.
                It keeps changing its settings to improve the chances of producing correct results.</p><br>
            <p class="text_content"> A generative model trained on cat images can create new ones by sampling from what
                it learned and refining the output through inference.</p><br>
            <p class="text_content"> The model fine-tunes its output during inference to improve accuracy and fix
                mistakes. This helps make the work more realistic and better match the user's preferences.</p><br>
