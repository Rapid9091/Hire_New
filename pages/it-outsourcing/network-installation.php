        <h2 class="content-heading">What is Home Networking Setup?</h2>
        <p class="text_content">A home network is a collection of devices, like computers, game systems, printers, and
            mobile devices, connected to the Internet and can communicate. There are two main ways that home networks
            connect to the Internet. </p>
            <div class="ul_div">
                <ul>
        <li>A wired network uses cables to connect devices like printers and scanners.</li>
        <li>A wireless network connects devices without cables.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="content_div">
    <h2 class="content-heading">Why Home Network Setup Is Important?</h2>
    <p class="text_content">There are several benefits to setting up a home network. Home networking enables you to
        accomplish several tasks, including: </p>
    <div class="ul_div">
        <ul>
        <li>Quickly access the Internet simultaneously from various devices such as computers, game systems, and mobile
            devices.</li>
        <li>You can view and open files and folders stored on any device connected to the same network as you.</li>
        <li>You can connect a single printer with multiple computers to print documents from each computer.</li>
        <li>Easily control the security settings for all your connected devices from a single location.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="text_content">If you want to set up a home network, here's some information to help you understand the
        available options. </p>
</div>
<div class="content_div">
    <h2 class="content-heading">How to get started with Home networking?</h2>
    <h3><strong>1) Assess home network equipment</strong></h3>
    <p class="text_content">When you are setting up a home network, there are specific hardware components that you
        should consider. </p>

    <p class="text_content"> These components are necessary for your network to function correctly. </p>
    To connect to the internet, you will need a few devices:
    <div class="ul_div">
        <ul>
            <li>You will need a cable or DSL modem, which is used to access the internet.</li>
            <li>You will need a router, which helps direct internet traffic to and from your network.</li>
            <li>You will need a switch to connect wired devices to your network.</li>
            <li>You will need an access point that allows wireless devices to connect to your network.</li>
        </ul>

    </div>
    <p class="text_content">Certain Internet Service Providers (ISPs) offer a single Customer Premises Equipment (CPE)
        device that can handle multiple network functions. </p>

    <p class="text_content">Some providers may only provide a single access device without additional networking
        features. This means that users will need to set up and expand their networks. </p>

    <p class="text_content">An Internet Service Provider (ISP) has various options for setting up a home network.
        Depending on the services provided by your internet service provider (ISP) and your specific requirements, you
        might need to purchase extra equipment to connect more devices to your internet connection. </p>
    <h3><strong>2) choose either wired or wireless devices</strong></h3>
    <p class="text_content">Some examples of wired devices are desktop computers, media streaming devices (like Roku or
        Apple TV), DVRs/cable boxes, and smart TVs. </p>

    <p class="text_content"> These devices must be connected to your internet router or modem using an Ethernet cable to
        access the internet and function properly. </p>

    <p class="text_content">Wired devices use an RJ-45 connector to connect through Ethernet. Devices such as computers
        often have both wired and wireless connections. Choose a wired connection over wireless for better speed and
        stability. </p>

    <p class="text_content">Wireless devices are electronic devices that can connect to the internet or other devices
        without physical cables. </p>

    <p class="text_content">Some examples of wireless devices are laptops, tablets, smartphones, devices for streaming
        media, and smart home devices such as security cameras, lights, doorbells, locks, and garage door openers. Home
        networks typically consist of a mix of wired and wireless devices. </p>
    <h3><strong>3) Connect Client Devices That Use Wires</strong></h3>
    <p class="text_content">To connect wired client devices, you will need to use Ethernet cables. These cables have
        connectors on each end that can be plugged into the Ethernet ports on your client devices, such as computers,
        gaming consoles, or smart TVs </p>
    <h3><strong>4) Extend Range of Home Network</strong></h3>
    <p class="text_content">The CPE (Customer Premises Equipment) is located in a central living area, such as a family
        room, which may be far from the home office. </p>

    <p class="text_content">To improve your network's range, it is essential to ensure that your Customer Premises
        Equipment (CPE), router, and Access Points (APs) are set up and configured to deliver the best performance. </p>
    <br>

    <p class="text_content">Your internet service provider (ISP) should ensure that your customer premises equipment
        (CPE) works efficiently. You can use online speed tests to check your router's and ISP's performance. </p>
    <h3><strong>5) Improve the efficiency of your network</strong></h3>
    <p class="text_content">A critical factor in network building is improving performance.Performance is evaluated
        using different methods, including: </p>
    <div class="ul_div">
        <ul>
            <li>Bandwidth usually measured in Mbps..</li>
            <li>Latency is the time it takes for a packet to arrive, measured in milliseconds.</li>
            <li>Jitter is the variation in latency, measured in milliseconds.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="text_content">Network speed tests provide various numbers that allow you to measure your performance
            and determine if any changes you make improve it.</p>

        a device that is installed as part of your Fios service. It can be placed outside or inside your home, such as
        in the garage, basement, or closet. </p>

    <p class="text_content">For your Verizon Fios network to work correctly, it must always stay connected to your ONT
        (Optical Network Terminal). </p>

<div class="content_div">
    <h2 class="content-heading">Is an ONT and Modem the Same Device?</h2>
    <p class="text_content">An Optical Network Terminal (ONT) is a device that connects your home or business to a fiber
        optic network. It is different from a modem, which is used to connect to a traditional copper-based network.
    </p>

    <p class="text_content"> For fiber-optic Internet, an ONT is like a modem that connects to the ISP. </p>

    <p class="text_content">There are three types of modems: telephone modems, DSL modems, and cable modems. An ONT is
        omitted. </p>

    <p class="text_content">An ONT eliminates needing a separate modem to connect with your ISP. It would need to be
        more effective. </p>

    <p class="text_content"> The ONT is similar to a modem because it relates to the ISP. However, it uses infrared
        light and fiber-optic wiring instead of traditional methods. You can access Wi-Fi by connecting the fiber router
        to your ONT. </p>

    <p class="text_content">A regular modem is incompatible with fiber technology because it uses light pulses. A modem
        converts an analog RF signal into a digital signal so that digital devices can understand it. </p>

    <p class="text_content">Fiber technology uses a single cable to send multiple signals simultaneously using light
        pulses. </p>

    <p class="text_content">Instead of connecting a device directly to a modem for a wired connection on a fiber
        network, you can connect your computer directly to an ONT. </p>

    <p class="text_content">The ONT is the final connection point between your local network and your ISP, allowing you
        to access the Internet. </p>
